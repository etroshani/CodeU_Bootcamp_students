#Welcome to your 2nd CODEU class!

#   In the 2nd class, we are covering these topics:
#       -print()
#       -additions, substractions, and multiplications using Python
#       -Strings, Integers, Floats



####    FIRST PART    ####

#   1) Recap of theory seen in the last class: Fun facts, Coding applications in the world, Types of languages, etc.

#   2) Learning how to use Visual Studio Code

#   3) Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans



####     SECOND PART    ####

##   1. Your first code!    ##

#   Code 'Hello World' and other possible Strings using print(). 


#   Defining a variable


#   Overriding a variable


#   Combining Strings



##   2. Turning Python into a Calculator!   ##

###     HOMEWORK   |    Creating an calculator! ###

# Create a calculator that can do additions, substractions and multiplications. Make sure to greet the user.
#       1) Greet the user using PRINT()
#       2) Addition: Calculate the sum of 123 456 and 876 544. Display the result using print()
#       3) Substraction: Subtract 555 from 10 000 and print the result.
#       4) Multiplication: Multiply 25, 26, and 27 and print the result.
#       5) Thank them for using the your Calculator
